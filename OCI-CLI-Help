oci
Usage: oci [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...

  Oracle Cloud Infrastructure command line interface, with support for
  Audit, Block Volume, Compute, Database, IAM, Load Balancing, Networking,
  DNS, File Storage, Email Delivery and Object Storage Services.

  Most commands must specify a service, followed by a resource type and then
  an action. For example, to list users (where $T contains the OCID of the
  current tenant):

    oci iam user list --compartment-id $T

  Output is in JSON format.

  --profile TEXT                  The profile in the config file to load. This
                                  profile will also be used to locate any
                                  default parameter values which have been
                                  specified in the OCI CLI-specific
                                  configuration file.  [default: DEFAULT]

  --cli-rc-file, --defaults-file TEXT
                                  The path to the OCI CLI-specific
                                  configuration file, containing parameter

                                  information such as command aliases and
                                  predefined queries.

                                  The --defaults-file option is deprecated and
                                  you should use the --cli-rc-file option
                                  instead.

                                  request.

  --region TEXT                   The region to make calls against.  For a
                                  list of valid region names use the command:
                                  "oci iam region list".

  --endpoint TEXT                 The value to use as the service endpoint,
                                  including any required API version path. For
                                  example: "https://iaas.us-
                                  phoenix-1.oracle.com/20160918". This will
                                  override the default service endpoint / API
                                  version path. Note: The --region parameter
                                  is the recommended way of targeting
                                  different regions.

                                  seconds to make establish connection from

  --read-timeout INTEGER          The value of the read timeout in seconds to
                                  wait for service calls to send response to
                                  sdk. This will override the default read
                                  timeout value of 60 secs.

  --cert-bundle TEXT              The full path to a CA certificate bundle to
                                  be used for SSL verification. This will

  --output [json|table]           The output format. [Default is json]
  --query TEXT                    JMESPath query [http://jmespath.org/] to run
                                  on the response JSON before output.

                                  Queries can be entered directly on the
                                  command line or referenced from the
                                  [OCI_CLI_COMMAND_ALIASES] section of your
                                  configuration file by using the syntax
                                  query://<query_name>, for example
                                  query://get_id_and_name

                                  For more information, see the Using Queries

                                  string value, this will return the string
                                  without surrounding quotes

  --auth [api_key|instance_principal|security_token|instance_obo_user|resource_principal]
                                  The type of auth to use for the API request.
                                  By default the API key in your config file
                                  will be used.  This value can also be
                                  provided in the OCI_CLI_AUTH environment
                                  variable.

  --auth-purpose TEXT             The The auth purpose which can be used in

  --generate-full-command-json-input

                                  all possible options that can be provided to
                                  this command.

                                  This JSON document can be saved to a file,
                                  modified with the appropriate option values,
                                  and then passed back via the --from-json
                                  option. This provides an alternative to
                                  typing options out on the command line.
                                  Example::     oci os bucket get
                                  --generate_full_command_json_input_r  >
                                  example.json     cat example.json Output::

                                      "namespaceName": "string"     }

                                  Edit the example.json file with correct
                                  values and use it as below ::

                                      file://example.json

  --generate-param-json-input TEXT
                                  Complex input, such as arrays and objects,
                                  are passed in JSON format.

                                  When passed the name of an option which
                                  takes complex input, this will print out
                                  example JSON of what needs to be passed to
                                  that option. Example::     oci compute
                                  instance launch
                                  --generate_param_json_input_r agent-config >
                                  example.json

                                      cat example.json Output::

                                      {       "areAllPluginsDisabled": true,
                                      "isManagementDisabled": true,

                                      "name": "string"         }       ]     }

                                  Edit the example.json file with correct
                                  values and use it as below ::

                                      oci compute instance launch --agent-
                                      config file://example.json

  --no-retry                      Disable retry logic for calls to services.
  --max-retries INTEGER           Maximum number of retry calls to be made to
                                  the service. For most commands, 5 attempts
                                  will be made. For operations with binary
                                  bodies, retries are disabled
